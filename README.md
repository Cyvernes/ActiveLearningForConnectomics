# Active Learning For Connectomics

This project aims to use Active Learning procedures on the [SAM model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) to perform mitochondrial segmentation with point annotation.

## Instalation

The instalation works well with python 3.10. Please follow the instruction of the [SAM repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#installation) to install SAM correctly. It is strongly recomended to do the installation in a new python environment.

Please install OpenCV and other depencies of the project.

```
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx
```

Clone the repository

```
git clone git@github.com:Cyvernes/ActiveLearningForConnectomics.git
```

## Getting Started

SAM needs a [model checkpoint](git@github.com:Cyvernes/ActiveLearningForConnectomics.git) to work properly. This project have been devellopped with the ViT-H SAM model, you can use this [link](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth) to download it.

## Description of the pipeline

This project implements a flexible pipeline to code easily any active learning strategy for segmentation.The pipeline contains a number of modules that can be used to code a large number of different strategies.

- 4 Learner types are available: 
    - test

## How to use the pipeline ?
### With AL_SAM


### With run_model
